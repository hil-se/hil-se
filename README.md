## About

We believe that "human AND AI" is much more powerful than "human OR AI" ([some external evidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/deloitte-consulting-2017/cognitive-collaboration-why-humans-and-computers-think-better-together/1196/)). 

The hil-se lab explores and provides machine learning solutions to assist humans in various software engineering tasks. These tasks include but are not limited to:
 - Retrieving relevant information.
 - Detecting and reducing ethical bias in human decisions.
 - Identifying certain software artifacts, e.g. security vulnerabilities, defects, tech debts, actionable static warnings.
 - Predicting for trace links between different software artifacts.
