## Courses

 - DSCI-633: [Foundation of Data Science](https://github.com/hil-se/fds). Introducing basic concepts of machine learning and the general workflow of how to solve a real problem with machine learning. The best way to learn an algorithm is to implement and apply it youself. You will experience that in this course.
 
## Tools

 - [FASTREAD](https://github.com/fastread/src): FASTREAD (FAST2) is a tool to support primary study selection in systematic literature review. More specifically, it helps users efficiently find their target relevant papers from a large number of search results.
